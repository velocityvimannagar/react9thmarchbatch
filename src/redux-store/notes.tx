- Redux - Centralized store
- Store is basically an object.

state = {
    users: [],
    posts: [],
    counter: {
        count: 0
    }
}

Difference between Context and Redux
- We can debug redux state changes.
- We can't debug value change of context.
- We have developer tools.
- Redux can have middlewares.
